Our objective is to design a recommendation system that predicts anime TV series ratings for a user based on previous anime ratings given by that user. In this project, we exploit the Neural Collaborative Filtering and implicit features like number of episodes to design a framework, based on user-anime, which recommends popular anime TV series.
